another rare backport to 1.21.1:

 - add Argentine Spanish translation (es_ar), thanks to Texaliuz!
 - update Simplified Chinese (zh_cn) translation, thanks to Q2297045667!
 - block-specific leaf textures via resource packs (see the [GitHub page](https://github.com/Fourmisain/fallingleaves/tree/1.21?tab=readme-ov-file#custom-textures) for details)
 - very slight adjustments to leaf physics
