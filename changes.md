add experimental "Register Leaf Particles" setting (on by default, just like before)
turning this setting off can fix issues when hosting a LAN server (e.g. via Essential) when the client doesn't have Falling Leaves installed,  
it will however also disallow the use of the `/particle` command (in singleplayer) and Sodium Extra won't be able to disable leaf particles
